### Hello! My name is Maria Sol Escobares 🙌

Who am I? 😊

I'm a Software Developer ✨🙋‍♀️. For some time, I've been deeply interested in technology and found programming to be a way to apply my passion to my work, contributing to generating a positive impact in my environment. Currently, I focus on creating projects that allow me to learn and apply the skills I've mastered, with JavaScript being the first language I learned. My main goal is to write high-impact code that helps solve everyday problems and keeps me at the forefront of technological solutions for emerging needs. I'm always looking to implement innovative ways to tackle existing challenges.
